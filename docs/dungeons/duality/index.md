## Walkthrough

### Introduction

The Duality dungeon is available from the moon:leviathan node. If you don't see the node for it, or have never done the dungeon before, you'll have to talk to Suraya Hawthorne(sp?) first and obtain a quest item for some reason.

Available modes:

- Normal - 1560 power
- Master? - 1590 power?

### First loading in

When you first arrive into Duality, you'll be at the end of a hallway. Walk forward towards Eris Moan and wait for her to finish talking. While you wait, admire the Calus statue.

Once she's done talking, the floor around the Calus statue will disappear and you'll fall down into the first transition area.

### Getting to the first encounter

Upon dropping down from Eris, walk forward to the fence ahead of you and you'll be introduced to one of the recurring mechanics of the dungeon: the bells.

#### Bell Mechanic
(insert picture of the first bell)

The bell mechanic can best be described as a trigger to change between realms, the `Normal Realm` and what I like to call the `Shadow Realm`. 

- `Normal Realm` - Everyday regular destiny
- `Shadow Realm` - Everything is red and darker

There are certain map geometries/interactibles that are only available in one of the given realms. Our goal is to use the bells to navigate through the transition area, swapping between realms as needed to progress.
