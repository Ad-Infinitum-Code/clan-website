## Utilities

Most of these sites will require authentication with Bungie.net in order to interact with the API and provide functionality. Authenticating is as easy as hitting the `login` or `authorize with Bungie` button and sign into Bungie.net how you normally would.

If at any time you'd like to de-authorize these apps, follow the below instructions:

1. Log into <a href="https://www.bungie.net/" target="_blank">Bungie.net</a>
2. Click on your player icon in the top right corner of the page.
3. In the flyout menu, click `Settings` all the way at the bottom, just above `Sign Out`.
4. On the left side menu, under `Account/Bungie`, click on `Account Linking`.
5. Scroll down to the `Authorized Applications` section.
6. Find the application you'd like to de-authorize.
7. Click the red `Unlink` bottom to the right of the desired application.
8. If you're sure, click the `Confirm` button in the dialog box. Otherwise click `Nevermind` to keep the application authorized.
9. After clicking `Confirm`, you'll still see the application in the list, however it'll have a status of `Revoked` and you'll no longer have the option to `Unlink`.

<!-- light.gg -->
### <a href="https://www.light.gg/" target="_blank">light.gg</a>

light.gg lets you easily search the entire Destiny 2 database for weapons, perks, armor, quests, triumphs, collectibles, basically anything that exists in the game. The most popular use case is to quickly look up all the potential perks on a desired weapon, as well as seeing what the community as a whole deems the "popular choices" for PvE, PvP, or both.

"D2Checklist uses the Bungie API to help make achieving your goals in Destiny easier and more fun."

<!-- bray.tech -->

"Braytech started as a checklist app and has bellowed into a monstrosity of many talents. It's always being refined and expanded."

Braytech takes some exploring to really see it's benefits and features. The main appeal is how much it mimics the in-game UI which makes navigation/understanding easier since it's something you're used to.

<!-- destiny optimizer -->
### <a href="https://destinyoptimizer.com/" target="_blank">Destiny Optimizer</a> 

Destiny Optimizer makes the power level grind more manageable every season. It'll analyze your current power level, pinnacle/powerful sources available, and give you a recommended path to maximize all your drops. It takes a little bit for all the new drop sources to be added/categorized each season, but it helps the grind tremendously!

<!-- todayindestiny -->
### <a href="https://www.todayindestiny.com/" target="_blank">Today in Destiny</a> 

Another website showing everything that's currently available. However, they have a really useful Eververse Calendar (found under `EV Calendar` at the top) that shows the predicted Eververse offerings for the entire season. This allows you to see when/if a particular item will be coming back around, ever sold for bright dust, etc.
